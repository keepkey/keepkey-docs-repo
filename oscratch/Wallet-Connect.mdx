# dApps are the most powerful part of KeepKey’s ecosystem

**ShapeShift** is just a dApp, and a dApp is simply a fancy way to say website. The goal of **KeepKey Desktop** is to present users with a safer way to manage their crypto than just using a Chrome web browser, where scams, phishing, and malware exist. However, at the end of the day, Electron is Chrome, and dApps in **KeepKey Desktop** are just websites. **KeepKey** curates a list of dApps. Some users never get past the “default” landing dApp, which is ShapeShift.

However, users often come out of their shell and learn more when:

1. There is a new coin feature or product they learn about and want to use with their KeepKey that ShapeShift doesn’t support. For instance, MayaCoin.
2. ShapeShift has an issue with their indexed nodes or experiences downtime on an asset or token that the user expects to see a balance for.

## My Favorite EVM Alternative for ShapeShift: Zerion

Let's talk about **Zerion**, which I’ve found to be highly reliable and supports many EVMs.

4. After clicking the **KeepKey** button in the corner, the KeepKey launch intent is loaded, and you approve the session.
