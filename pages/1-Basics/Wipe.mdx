# Handling Forgotten PINs

If you forgot your PIN, don't fret! You can always wipe your KeepKey and restore it from seed, then set a new pin.

## On Startup

1. Click **"Forgot your pin"**.

   <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
     <Image
       src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*lKwRIb6MBGpbr23blV_OMA.png"
       alt="Forgot your pin"
       width={300}
       height={400}
     />
   </div>

2. Next, wipe your device.

   <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
     <Image
       src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*mT_UPt0kUa77RPddPyINbQ.png"
       alt="Wipe your device"
       width={300}
       height={400}
     />
   </div>

## After Wiping Your Device

After wiping your device, you can proceed to device recovery.

> **Note:** If for any reason this feature is not working in KeepKey Desktop, you can also use our legacy updater app.
