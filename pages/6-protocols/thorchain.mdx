# Introduction to THORChain

THORChain is an innovative decentralized protocol that enables cross-chain asset exchanges without the need for wrapped tokens or intermediaries. It functions as a multi-chain decentralized exchange (DEX) that addresses one of the most significant challenges in the blockchain space: fragmented liquidity across different chains.

At its core, THORChain allows users to swap native cryptocurrencies from various blockchain networks seamlessly. For example, you can directly exchange Bitcoin for Ethereum or other supported assets without going through a centralized exchange. This is made possible through THORChain's unique architecture, which includes:

## Key Components

1. **Nodes**: A network of computers that validate and process transactions.
2. **Vaults**: Secure storage for assets from different blockchains during the swapping process.
3. **Liquidity Pools**: Where assets are stored and made available for trading.

THORChain utilizes its native token, **RUNE**, as a bridge currency to facilitate these cross-chain swaps. When you initiate a swap, your original asset is converted to RUNE and then to the desired asset, all happening behind the scenes.

One of THORChain's key features is its use of **Continuous Liquidity Pools (CLPs)**, which maximize efficiency in asset exchanges. The protocol also emphasizes security and decentralization, implementing innovations like **Capped Proof of Bond** for validator selection and a high churn schedule to resist centralization.

By eliminating the need for wrapped assets and providing a trustless, decentralized platform for cross-chain exchanges, THORChain aims to increase liquidity across the cryptocurrency ecosystem and offer users a more seamless experience in managing their digital assets.
