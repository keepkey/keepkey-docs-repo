# Build on KeepKey Today with Our New SDK

[Explore the KeepKey SDK on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@keepkey/keepkey-sdk)

## TL;DR

We're revolutionizing the KeepKey ecosystem by unveiling a new developer SDK, alleviating major points of friction.

### Terms:

- **WebUSB**: The web protocol for your host machine to communicate with your KeepKey Device.
- **HID**: The native USB protocol for communication between your host machine and your KeepKey Device.
- **Browser**: Web browsers like Chrome or Brave.
- **Electron**: A native application framework running on your host machine outside of a web browser.

## Now, What's Possible?

For the first time with a KeepKey, you can:

- Have Firefox open and pair a KeepKey with app.shapeshift.com.
- Pair the same KeepKey with a Chrome tab.
- Use KeepKey Desktopâ€™s built-in browser with ShapeShift open.

All applications are connected and functional simultaneously, offering seamless interaction.

### The Challenge Before

WebUSB was the main interface for KeepKey prior to our acquisition, which imposed a significant limitation: it only allowed a single application to access the device at a time due to the `claimInterface` feature.

### The Solution: The New KeepKey Desktop

KeepKey desktop now serves as the primary interface for building on KeepKey. It supplies native HID USB drivers, manages advanced features like PIN management in BIP39 mnemonics, and importantly, introduces a new KeepKey REST interface hosted on the user's localhost.

### Introducing the KeepKey REST Interface

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>

    alt="KeepKey REST Interface"
    width={700}
    height={400}
    layout="intrinsic"
  />
</div>

Developer documentation is accessible at `http://localhost:1645/docs` or through the KeepKey app's settings.

## KeepKey-SDK: The New Developer Kit

Developers now have complete access to the KeepKey's REST API and TypeScript typing for coding assistance through the KeepKey-SDK.

### Case Study: ShapeShift.com Integration

The HDwallet package is at the heart of app.shapeshift.com, integrating the REST interface.

- [GitHub Pull Request #3678](https://github.com/shapeshift/web/pull/3678)

This new KeepKey REST API paves the way for future innovative applications to integrate and offer users a self-custody solution.
